## pandas 2022

This repository hosts introductory pandas tutorials prepared for the 2022 offering of the [Programming 3 course](http://ai.fon.bg.ac.rs/osnovne/programiranje-3/) at [University of Belgrade](http://www.bg.ac.rs/en/)

Note: If a notebook fails to open on GitHub (you get the message "Sorry, something went wrong. Reload?" ), or is incorrectly rendered, you can open it on [NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/). Just go to the [NBViewer home page](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/) and paste the link to the notebook there - the rendering is even better than at GitHub.
